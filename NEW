Whats new in this version:
 * bmod/bdiv use _upgrade_2 and return now more often Lite instead of BigInt
 * as_number() returns always BigInt
 * fixed bone() etc (were returning always BigInt and/or failing)
 * autodetec how big Lite objects can be (fixes overflow)
 * added _upgrade_2_mul() 
 * perl-Mbignum now works under Lite
 * new() can handle 1e10 style strings
 * better overload code for +, ++, --,

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
